# opengl-liquor-store
Academic project for computer graphics class. Liquor store "simulation" made with OpenGL, Bullet Physics and C++11

Contains models and compiled dependencies, in res and dep folders consecutively.

Written under MS Windows.

Some configuration might be required in order to run it on your machine - I might add a guide, but rn the best way would be to create MS Visual Studio solution, import those files and point (possibly also compile) dependencies yourself.
