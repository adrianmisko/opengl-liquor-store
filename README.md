# opengl-liquor-store
Academic project for computer graphics class. Liquor store "simulation" made with OpenGL, Bullet Physics and C++11

Contains models and compiled dependencies, in res and dep folders respectively.

Written under MS Windows, with Visual Studio 15

Some configuration might be required in order to run it on your machine - I might add a guide, but rn the best way would be to create MS Visual Studio solution, import those files and point (possibly also compile) dependencies yourself.
